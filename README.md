# Decoding Sign Language: A Deep Learning Approach with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## 🔄 Overview:
This project aims to utilize the power of deep learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images of hands doing sign language. The model, inspired by the DCGAN architecture, will be trained on a dataset of hand images performing sign language gestures. The ultimate goal is to decode sign language and bring attention to the deaf and hard of hearing community.

## 🎊 Motivation:
Sign language is a valuable means of communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community. However, it is often neglected and overlooked in society. With the advancement of deep learning and computer vision, this project aims to bridge the gap and shed light on the importance of sign language by decoding it into images that are easily understandable by the wider audience.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and how they work
